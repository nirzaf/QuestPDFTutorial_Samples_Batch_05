QuestPDF is an open-source .NET library for PDF documents generation.

It offers a layouting engine designed with full paging support in mind. The document consists of many simple elements (e.g. border, background, image, text, padding, table, grid, etc.) composed together to create more complex structures. This way, as a developer, you can understand the behaviour of every element and use them with complete confidence. Additionally, the document and all its features support paging functionality. For example, a part can be moved to the next page (if there is insufficient space) or split between pages like table rows.

Unlike other libraries, it does not rely on the HTML-to-PDF conversion, which is not reliable in many cases. Instead, it implements its own optimised layout engine to cover all paging-related requirements.

## Please show the value

Choosing a project dependency could be difficult. We need to ensure the stability and maintainability of our projects. Surveys show that GitHub stars count plays an important factor when assessing library quality.

## Please share with the community

As an open-source project without funding, I cannot afford to advertise QuestPDF in a typical way. Instead, the library relies on community interactions. Please consider sharing a post about QuestPDF and the value it provides. It does help!
