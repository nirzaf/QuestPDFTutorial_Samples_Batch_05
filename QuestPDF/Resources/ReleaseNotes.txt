Release theme:
Introduced the QuestPDF Previewer tool - a hot-reload powered, cross-platform program that visualizes your PDF document and updates its preview every time you make a code change. You don't need to recompile your code after every small adjustment. Save time and enjoy the design process! (available only for dotnet 6 and beyond)

Other changes:
- Improved default word-wrapping algorithm to better handle words which do not fit on the available width,
- Introduced new word-wrapping option 'WrapAnywhere' that wraps word at the last possible character instead of moving it into new line.
